Package Lists
===============================================================================

This is where you list the packages that are to be installed during various phases of the build process.  The most common case will be to list packages, one per line, in files ending in _*.list.chroot_/.  These are the packages that will be installed in your image chroot environment during the build.

See _packages.list.chroot.example_ for details.
